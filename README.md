# Picker - Harm Reduction Substance Tracker

A progressive web application designed to help individuals track and evaluate their psychotropic substance use through harm reduction principles.

## About

Picker is built on the foundation of harm reduction - a set of practical strategies and ideas aimed at reducing negative consequences associated with drug use. The app does not promote or encourage substance use, but rather provides tools for those who choose to use substances to do so more safely.

### Harm Reduction Principles

This app is guided by the following harm reduction principles:

1. **Acceptance** - Acknowledging that substance use exists and working to minimize harmful effects rather than ignoring or condemning
2. **Evidence-based** - Using proven strategies to reduce health risks and negative consequences
3. **Non-judgmental** - Providing services without stigma, discrimination, or moral judgment
4. **User-centered** - Empowering individuals as the primary agents of their own health and well-being
5. **Pragmatic** - Focusing on practical, achievable steps toward safer use
6. **Incremental** - Recognizing that positive change can occur in small steps
